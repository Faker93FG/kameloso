// parseBasic
/++
 +  Parses the most basic of IRC events; PING, ERROR, PONG and NOTICE.
 +
 +  They syntactically differ from other events in that they are not prefixed
 +  by their sender.
 +
 +  The IRCEvent is finished at the end of this function.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      ref event = the IRCEvent to fill out the members of.

void parseBasic(ref IRCEvent event, ref IRCBot bot) @trusted
{

// parsePrefix
/++
 +  Takes a slice of a raw IRC string and starts parsing it into an IRCEvent struct.
 +
 +  This function only focuses on the prefix; the sender, be it nickname and ident
 +  or server address.
 +
 +  The IRCEvent is not finished at the end of this function.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      ref event = A reference to the IRCEvent to start working on.
 +      ref slice = A reference to the slice of the raw IRC string.
 +/
void parsePrefix(ref IRCEvent event, ref IRCBot bot, ref string slice)
{
}

// parseTypestring
/++
 +  Takes a slice of a raw IRC string and continues parsing it into an IRCEvent struct.
 +
 +  This function only focuses on the typestring; the part that tells what kind of event
 +  happened, like PRIVMSG or MODE or NICK or KICK, etc; in string format.
 +
 +  The IRCEvent is not finished at the end of this function.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      ref event = A reference to the IRCEvent to continue working on.
 +      ref slice = A reference to the slice of the raw IRC string.
 +/
void parseTypestring(ref IRCEvent event, ref IRCBot bot, ref string slice)
{
}

// parseSpecialcases
/++
 +  Takes a slice of a raw IRC string and continues parsing it into an IRCEvent struct.
 +
 +  This function only focuses on specialcasing the remaining line, dividing it
 +  into fields like target, channel, content, etc.
 +
 +  IRC events are *riddled* with inconsistencies, so this function is very very
 +  long but by neccessity.
 +
 +  The IRCEvent is finished at the end of this function.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      ref event = A reference to the IRCEvent to finish working on.
 +      ref slice = A reference to the slice of the raw IRC string.
 +/
void parseSpecialcases(ref IRCEvent event, ref IRCBot bot, ref string slice)

}


// postparseSanityCheck
/++
 +  Checks for some specific erroneous edge cases in an IRCEvent, complains
 +  about all of them and corrects some.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      ref event = the IRC event to examine.
 +/
void postparseSanityCheck(ref IRCEvent event, const IRCBot bot)
{
}


// parseTwitchTags
/++
 +  Parses a Twitch event's IRCv3 tags.
 +
 +  The event is passed by ref as many tags neccessitate changes to it.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      ref event = A reference to the IRCEvent whose tags should be parsed.
 +/
void parseTwitchTags(ref IRCEvent event, ref IRCBot bot)
{
}


// prioritiseTwoRoles
/++
 +  Compares a given IRCEvent.Role to a role string and decides which of the
 +  two weighs the most; which takes precedence over the other.
 +
 +  This is used to decide what role a user has when they are of several at the
 +  same time. A moderator might be a partner and a subscriber at the same
 +  time, for instance.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      current = The right-hand-side IRCEvent.Role to compare with.
 +      newRole = A Role in lowercase, left-hand-side to compare with.
 +
 +  Returns:
 +      the IRCEvent.Role with the highest priority of the two.
