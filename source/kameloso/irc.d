// onPRIVMSG
/++
 +  Handle `QUERY` and `CHAN` messages (`PRIVMSG`).
 +
 +  Whether it is a private query message or a channel message is only obvious
 +  by looking at the target field of it; if it starts with a `#`, it is a
 +  channel message.
 +
 +  Also handle `ACTION` events (`/me slaps foo with a large trout`), and change
 +  the type to `CTCP_`-types if applicable.

// onISUPPORT

 +  `ISUPPORT` contains a bunch of interesting information that changes how we
 +  look at the `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCServer`. Notably which *network* the server
 +  is of and its max channel and nick lengths, and available modes. Then much

 +  Handle `MYINFO` events.
 +
 +  `MYINFO` contains information about which *daemon* the server is running.
 +  We want that to be able to meld together a good `typenums` array.
 +
 +  Params:

// toIRCEvent
/++
 +  Parses an IRC string into an `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCEvent`.
 +
 +  Parsing goes through several phases (prefix, typestring, specialcases) and
 +  this is the function that calls them, in order.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      parser = Reference to the current `IRCParser`.

public:


// decodeIRCv3String
/++
 +  Decodes an IRCv3 tag string, replacing some characters.
 +
 +  IRCv3 tags need to be free of spaces, so by neccessity they're encoded into
 +  `\s`. Likewise; since tags are separated by semicolons, semicolons in tag
 +  string are encoded into `\:`, and literal backslashes `\\`.
 +
 +  Example:
 +  ---
 +  string encoded = `This\sline\sis\sencoded\:\swith\s\\s`;
 +  string decoded = decodeIRCv3String(encoded);
 +  assert(decoded == "This line is encoded; with \\s");
 +  ---
 +
 +  Params:
 +      line = Original line to decode.

// isFromAuthService

 +  }
 +  ---
 +
 +  Params:
 +      parser = Reference to the current `IRCParser`.
 +      event = `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCEvent` to examine.
 +
 +  Returns:

 +      not.

// isValidChannel
/++
 +  Examines a string and decides whether it *looks* like a channel.
 +
 +  It needs to be passed an `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCServer` to know the max
 +  channel name length. An alternative would be to change the
 +  `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCServer` parameter to be an `uint`.
 +
 +  Example:
 +  ---
 +  IRCServer server;
 +  assert("#channel".isValidChannel(server));
 +  assert("##channel".isValidChannel(server));
 +  assert(!"!channel".isValidChannel(server));
 +  assert(!"#ch#annel".isValidChannel(server));
 +  ---
 +
 +  Params:
 +      line = String of a potential channel name.
 +      server = The current `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCServer` with all its settings.
 +
 +  Returns:
 +      `true` if the string content is judged to be a channel, `false` if not.
 +/
bool isValidChannel(const string line, const IRCServer server) pure @nogc

/++
 +  Checks if a string *looks* like a nickname.
 +
 +  It only looks for invalid characters in the name as well as it length.
 +
 +  Example:

 +  assert("kameloso".isValidNickname);
 +  assert("kameloso^".isValidNickname);
 +  assert("kamelåså".isValidNickname);
 +  assert(!"#kameloso".isValidNickname);
 +  assert(!"k&&me##so".isValidNickname);
 +  ---
 +
 +  Params:
 +      nickname = String nickname.
 +      server = The current `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCServer` with all its settings.
 +
 +  Returns:
 +      `true` if the nickname string is judged to be a nickname, `false` if
 +      not.
 +/
bool isValidNickname(const string nickname, const IRCServer server) pure nothrow @nogc
{

// isValidNicknameCharacter
/++
 +  Determines whether a passed `char` can be part of a nickname.
 +
 +  The IRC standard describes nicknames as being a string of any of the
 +  following characters:
 +
 +  `[a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] _-\[]{}^`|`
 +
 +  Example:
 +  ---
 +  assert('a'.isValidNicknameCharacter);
 +  assert('9'.isValidNicknameCharacter);
 +  assert('`'.isValidNicknameCharacter);
 +  assert(!(' '.isValidNicknameCharacter));
 +  ---
 +
 +  Params:
 +      c = Character to compare with the list of accepted characters in a
 +          nickname.
 +
 +  Returns:
 +      `true` if the character is in the list of valid characters for
 +      nicknames, `false` if not.
 +/

{
    return false;
}


// containsNickname
/++
 +  Searches a string for a substring that isn't surrounded by characters that
 +  can be part of a nickname. This can detect a nickname in a string without
 +  getting false positives from similar nicknames.
 +
 +  Uses `std.string.indexOf` internally with hopes of being more resilient to
 +  weird UTF-8.
 +
 +  Params:
 +      haystack = A string to search for the substring nickname.
 +      needle = The nickname substring to find in `haystack`.
 +
 +  Returns:
 +      True if `haystack` contains `needle` in such a way that it is guaranteed
 +      to not be a different nickname.
 +/
bool containsNickname(const string haystack, const string needle) pure
{
    return false;
}


// stripModesign
/++
 +  Takes a nickname and strips it of any prepended mode signs, like the `@` in
 +  `@nickname`. Saves the stripped signs in the ref string `modesigns`.
 +
 +  Example:
 +  ---
 +  IRCServer server;
 +  immutable signed = "@+kameloso";
 +  string signs;
 +  immutable nickname = server.stripModeSign(signed, signs);
 +  assert((nickname == "kameloso"), nickname);
 +  assert((signs == "@+"), signs);
 +  ---
 +
 +  Params:
 +      server = `kameloso.ircdefs.IRCServer`, with all its settings.
 +      nickname = String with a signed nickname.
 +      modesigns = Reference string to write the stripped modesigns to.
 +
 +  Returns:
 +      The nickname without any prepended prefix signs.
 +/

    ref string modesigns) pure nothrow @nogc
{
    return "";

// stripModesign
/++
 +  Convenience function to `stripModesign` that doesn't take a ref string
 +  parameter to store the stripped modesign characters in.
 +
 +  Example:
 +  ---
 +  IRCServer server;
 +  immutable signed = "@+kameloso";
 +  immutable nickname = server.stripModeSign(signed);
 +  assert((nickname == "kameloso"), nickname);
